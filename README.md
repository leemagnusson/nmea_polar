Convert nmea 0183 data into a sailing polar


Probably not useful for public consumption. I have a bunch of nmea 0183 data that I've recorded and I want to parse it and extract a sailing polar based on my averages. It's difficult because I don't know when I'm motoring vs. sailing, and the data has lots of other issues as well. I'm uploading all of the data as well as a python script to parse.
